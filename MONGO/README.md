MongoDB and Mongoose is learnt, where usage of Mongoshell and Mongoose through JavaScript is done
The Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations will be the first basis of learning, then as time goes, we will move more.
After learning about these Databases & some More JS Node Techniques (Authentication,etc). we will move entirely to pursue Projects and strengthening our grip on Front-End and Back-End Engineering.
